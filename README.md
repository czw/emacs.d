Personal Emacs configuration
============================

[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the foundation for a text
editor customized to your wishes. This is my own setup. Feel free to take
inspiration from it and try out parts you like.

Things that you should install using your OS package manager:
* ripgrep
